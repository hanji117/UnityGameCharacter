# UnityGameCharacter
# Satella
SatellaAnimation6.blend has the character, Satella, that I created using Blender. Check out her animations.
To view her animations go to the top mid left. Choose the screen layout animatingSetUpAndReadyToGo. Adjust the "User Ortho view" to your
desire. Do this by using the mouses middle button to move the camera. Scroll to zoom in or out. On the left side in the "Browse Action
to be linked" input box choose any of the animations that have an F to view them. You could view the other ones without the F but they are not satisfactory to me. Plus, I couldn't delete them so they're there. Right click on one of the lines that are on the character. It will turn light blue. Then press "a" on your keyboard. This will turn all the lines around her light blue. Then you'll see these yellow vertical lines at the bottom of the page. Adjust the start and end to match the beginning yellow line and the last yellow line. The area should be light grey from the first yellow line to the last yellow line. Press the play button to 
see the animation. To get a better view of it turn the eye off next to armature. It's in the bottom left box. 

# Luna
texturing5.blend has the character, Luna, that I created (using Blender) for the Unity game, The Almanac.
